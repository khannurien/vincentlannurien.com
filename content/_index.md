I am Vincent Lannurien, an **Associate Professor** (*Maître de Conférences*) at Lab-STICC, Université de Bretagne Occidentale (Brest, France).

Before that, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at Lab-STICC, ENSTA (Brest, France).

Between 2021 and 2024, I have been working on **optimizing allocation and scheduling policies** in the cloud; see [my PhD thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04941961) and [defense slides](./resources/phd_defense.pdf).
